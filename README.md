# Production-Data-Analyser
This program is designed to visualise data (typically measurements of production as  recorded by LC/MS, GC/MS, HPLC or other detection methods) in the form of bar plots. The program takes an input file with data and optionally a standard that converts the raw data to concentrations.  Concentrations can also be given directly. Regression lines can be plotted for standard.  The program enables creating and exporting visually pleasing graphs with multiple bars for each sample (defined as 'methods' in the experimental sense),  with error bars, and each method can have its own standard. Many graph parameters can be set custom and the program allows the creation of bar plots with a table in place of the x-axis labels (frequently used for synoptical visualisation of sample differences).  Additionally, paired or independent t-tests can be calculated on the data and the visualisation of significance is shown in the graph as asterisks.   Author: Lucie Studena
